# litecoin-regtest-box
This project is to simulate multiple nodes on a p2p network running litecoin and to convert it into a landcoin for land transactions by using docker containers to simulate the nodes. The folder group1 contains docker-compose.yml file which brings up 10 containers listening to each other, whereas that in group2 folder brings up another 10 containers listening to the nodes on group1.

Below I will explain the setup to get a working model.
