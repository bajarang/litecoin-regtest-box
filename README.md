# litecoin-regtest-box
This project is to use litecoin and to convert it into a landcoin for land transactions. The p2p network is simulated using the docker containers which listen to each other on a bridge network. 

## Initial Setup :
I will explain the setup to get a working model. There are two directories group1 and group2. Each contain one Dockerfile and one docker-compose.yml file. 

#### group1 directory


#### group2 directory
